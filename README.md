# Neutron Board Game
I coded this game in 2 days, focusing on its logic (and that's why it's visually ugly) and trying to get used to Unity enviroment and C# programming language. What's more, I tried to keep using good practices despite my non-familiarity with GameObject, MonoBehaviour, etc classes, but I think that, in retrospect, it can be substantially improved.

# Rules
The game is based on a 5x5 board with 5 black pieces, 5 white pieces and 1 green piece, the Neutron. Any player wins when the Neutron is put over the initial position of any of his/her pieces. Per turn, players have 2 phases: in the first one they have to move the Neutron, and in the second one they have to move one of their pieces. Movement must be a straight line in any direction (including diagonal movements) until its following square is occupied by another piece or it's the edge of the board.
