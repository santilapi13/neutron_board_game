# Neutron Board Game
I coded this game in 2 days, focusing on its logic (and that's why it's visually ugly) and trying to get used to Unity enviroment and C# programming language. What's more, I tried to keep using good practices despite my non-familiarity with GameObject, MonoBehaviour, etc classes, but I think that, in retrospect, it can be substantially improved.
